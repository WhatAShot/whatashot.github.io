Hey, I am Jintai Chen, a tenure-track assistant professor at HKUST, guangzhou campus.

Prior to that, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Illinois, USA. I obtained my Ph.D. from the College of Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University. My research interests lie at the intersection of AI and healthcare, with a particular focus on developing generalizable and reliable foundation models to address real-world medical challenges, including clinical trial optimization, clinical predictive modeling, treatment recommendation, health monitoring, and biomedical discovery.

<span style="color:#AA381E">I am actively seeking highly motivated Ph.D. students, Research Assistants, and postdoctoral researchers with strong backgrounds in computer science, statistics, or other related subjects. Proficiency in coding is required.

<!-- Before that, I graduated with a Ph.D. degree from the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University. 
I am broadly fascinated by the intersection of AI and healthcare/bioscience, especially the field of AI for healthcare (<span style="color:#D70761">AI4H</span>), with a specific emphasis on designing machine learning algorithms informed by medical knowledge and utilizing machine learning for uncovering insights in medical data. My research extensively delves into various facets including AI for medical imaging analysis (<span style="color:#8866FF;">AI4MIA</span>), AI for electrocardiograms (<span style="color:RoyalBlue">AI4ECG</span>), AI for EHR table analysis (<span style="color:orange;">AI4Table</span>), and AI for clinical trials (<span style="color:SeaGreen">AI4CT</span>). My methodological interests revolve around deep tabular models, generative AI for digital twin creation, and exploring deep learning approaches tailored for scenarios with limited data availability. --> 

<!-- I have published over 30 papers on top international AI conferences and top AI4Healthcare conferences/ journals.-->

<!-- I was honored with the *National Scholarship of China* in 2015 and 2021, and won the *Tencent Doctoral Scholarship* in 2021, the *Huawei Fundamental Research Scholarship* in 2022. I am the core member of our team participating MICCAI competitions, and we won <span style="color:red">the 1-st place</span> in the Challenge of Signet Ring Cell Detection and in the Challenge of Organ-At-Risk Segmentation from Chest CT Scans, and <span style="color:red">the 2-nd place</span> in the Challenge of Colonoscopy Tissue Segmentation. -->

<!-- I am an amateur snooker player and a big fan of [Ronnie O'Sullivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_O%27Sullivan), and I also enjoy painting in my leisure time. -->
