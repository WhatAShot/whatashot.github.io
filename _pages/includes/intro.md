Hey, I'm Jintai Chen, a tenure-track assistant professor at HKUST (Guangzhou), also affiliated with the Clear Water Bay Campus.

Prior to that, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I collaborated closely with Prof. Jimeng Sun. I obtained my Ph.D. from the College of Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University, under the supervision of Prof. Jian Wu. My research interests lie at the intersection of AI and healthcare, with a particular focus on developing generalizable foundation models and generative models to address real-world medical challenges, including clinical trial optimization, biomedical discovery, clinical predictive modeling, and health monitoring.

<span style="color:#AA381E">I am actively seeking highly motivated Ph.D. students, research assistants, and postdoctoral researchers with strong backgrounds in computer science, statistics, or other related subjects. Proficiency in coding is required.</span>

<!-- Before that, I graduated with a Ph.D. degree from the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University. 
I am broadly fascinated by the intersection of AI and healthcare/bioscience, especially the field of AI for healthcare (<span style="color:#D70761">AI4H</span>), with a specific emphasis on designing machine learning algorithms informed by medical knowledge and utilizing machine learning for uncovering insights in medical data. My research extensively delves into various facets including AI for medical imaging analysis (<span style="color:#8866FF;">AI4MIA</span>), AI for electrocardiograms (<span style="color:RoyalBlue">AI4ECG</span>), AI for EHR table analysis (<span style="color:orange;">AI4Table</span>), and AI for clinical trials (<span style="color:SeaGreen">AI4CT</span>). My methodological interests revolve around deep tabular models, generative AI for digital twin creation, and exploring deep learning approaches tailored for scenarios with limited data availability. -->

<!-- I was honored with the *National Scholarship of China* in 2015 and 2021, and won the *Tencent Doctoral Scholarship* in 2021, the *Huawei Fundamental Research Scholarship* in 2022. I am the core member of our team participating MICCAI competitions, and we won <span style="color:red">the 1-st place</span> in the Challenge of Signet Ring Cell Detection and in the Challenge of Organ-At-Risk Segmentation from Chest CT Scans, and <span style="color:red">the 2-nd place</span> in the Challenge of Colonoscopy Tissue Segmentation. -->

<!-- I am an amateur snooker player and a big fan of [Ronnie O'Sullivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_O%27Sullivan), and I also enjoy painting in my leisure time. -->
